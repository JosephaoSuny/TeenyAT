# TeenyAT Color LCD

![lcd demos](../docs/img/lcd_demo.gif)

Welcome to the **TeenyAT** color LCD! This system provides a creative workspace to develop
interesting and unique graphical assembly programs. The LCD includes a 64 x 64 pixel array that can be written to in order to control the output of the screen. The LCD exposes two distinct screen areas for addressing pixels:

- a live screen that updates instantly
- an off-screen buffer for precalculating pixel values

The Color LCD also supports both mouse and keyboad support as well as the ability to print out register values to the terminal
