# TeenyAT Edison Experiment Board

![edison demos](../docs/img/edison_demo.gif)

Welcome to the **TeenyAT** Edison Experiment Board! This system provides a custom pcb to develop interesting
demos using TeenyAT assembly. Featuring a 20x4 terminal lcd and numerous peripheral devices we give you full control
of the system to do whatever you or [Leroy](../docs/leroy.md) desires!

Some of the features include:

- a 20x4 terminal lcd featuring ASCII and 104 unique sprites
- 8 seven segment displays with multiple different rendering modes
- 8 reactive push buttons
- 4 toggleable dip swithes
- 2 sets of 16 fadeable leds
- 2 buzzers with sine and triangle wave forms
- 2 linear faders
- 1 four directional d-pad

The Edison's buttons and peripherals are linked to the TeenyATs 2 different 16-bit ports allowing for highly interactive programs
